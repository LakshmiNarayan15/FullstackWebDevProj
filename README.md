Extract the zip file "Leaf-Now(FSWD Proj)" and open the folder in VS Code.

{Due to the lack of coordination and cooperation of my team members(not involving themselves in the project and not responding whenever they are called)
and the lack of knowledge of concepts within myself(as I am a beginner),
this is the best we could do.
This project folder contains the front end part for the LeafNow project, it includes the html file,css file(for login.html),js file(for login.html).}
